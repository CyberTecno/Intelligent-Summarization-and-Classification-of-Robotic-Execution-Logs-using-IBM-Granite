🧠 Project Title

Intelligent Summarization and Classification of Robotic Execution Logs using IBM Granite

📝 Short Description (untuk bagian "About" GitHub)

🚀 A capstone project that uses IBM Granite AI to automatically summarize and classify robotic execution logs.
The system helps analyze robot behavior, detect failure patterns, and provide concise insights for maintenance and optimization.
Built and tested using Google Colab + Replicate API.

📘 Full Description (untuk README GitHub)

This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) like IBM Granite can be applied to robotics data analytics — specifically to summarize and identify patterns within robotic execution logs.

Robotic systems generate extensive log data that is often difficult to interpret manually.
By leveraging IBM Granite's summarization and reasoning capabilities, this project transforms raw log data into structured, human-readable insights that highlight:

🔍 Key operational events

⚠️ Common failure types

🧠 Root cause patterns

💡 Recommended corrective actions

The project combines Summarization (to compress log data into actionable insights) and Mini Classification (to categorize detected failure patterns).
